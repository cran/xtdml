# XTDML
The `xtdml` package implements double machine learning (DML) for static partially linear regression models for panel data with fixed effects, as in [Clarke and Polselli (2025)](https://academic.oup.com/ectj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ectj/utaf011/8120202?login=false). 
The `xtdml` package is built on the `DoubleML` package by Bach et al. (2022) using the `mlr3` ecosystem and the same notation.

## The Partially Linear Panel Regression Model
The `xtdml` package estimates the structural (causal) parameter from panel data models: 
```math
  Y_{it} = \theta_0 D_{it} + g_0(X_{it}) + \alpha_i + U_{it}
```
```math  
  D_{it} = m_0(X_{it}) + \gamma_i + V_i,
```
where 
  * $Y_{it}$ is the output, $D_{it}$ the treatment, $X_{it}$ the covariates
  * $\theta_0$ is the structural (causal) parameter to *estimate*; 
  * $(l_0, m_0)$ are (possibly nonlinear) nuisance functions to *learn* from the data using one of the tree proposed approaches ("fd-exact", "wg-approx", "cre");
  * ($\alpha_i, \gamma_i$) are the unobserved individual heterogeneity correlated with the included covariates;
  * ($U_{it}$, $V_{it}$) are disturbances.

> [!NOTE]
> The current version of the package allows the user to immediately use the estimation tools *without the need to* proceed with additional data managing and transformations.
> In particular, the user can choose:
>
>  1. The panel data approach to use among `approach = ("fd-exact", "wg-approx", "cre")`; default is `"fd-exact"`. `xtdml` proceeds with transforming the data based on the selected approach, following Clarke and Polselli (2025).
>
> 2. The type of transformation to apply to the covariates $X$ in the data set among `transformX = ("no", "minmax", "poly")`. `"no"` does not transform the covariates `X` and is recommended for tree-based learners. `"minmax"` applies the Min-Max normalization  $x' = (x-x_{min})/(x_{max}-x_{min})$ to the covariates and is recommended with neural networks. `"poly"` add polynomials up to order three and interactions between all possible combinations of two and three variables; this is recommended for Lasso. Default is `"no"`.


> [!CAUTION]
> 1. The package has been renamed `xtdml` from `XTDML`!
> 
> 2. Previous versions of the package allowed for **treatment endogeneity** in the partially linear panel regression model. This option has been *temporally removed*, but we are currently working on including IV estimation and weak IV tests in the current version of the `xtdml` package. (Panel IV DML *coming soon*)
> 
> 3. With the current version of the package it is **no longer possible** to choose the **hybrid approach**; this is consistent with the published version of the article.
>    
> 4. Vignettes will be added soon.
